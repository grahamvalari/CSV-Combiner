# CSV Combiner - Valari Graham 

This is a command line program that takes in several CSV files as arguments and will output a new CSV file that contains the rows from each of the inputs. The new CSV file contains an added column that has the file from which the row originated. 

The chosen language for this challenge is Python due to its pandas library. The pandas library is a very powerful tool for data manipulation which makes it perfect for this challenge. 

After turning the CSV files into dataframes, they were easy to manipulate into a master dataframe with an added column. 

The python file runs well in the terminal and exports the combined CSV.
